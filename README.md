# VulnerabilityScanner
Basic Vulnerability scanner that uses a modified version of the port scanner from the port scanner repository. I created a test text file of the software that i found running on the open ports of my router ( I did the test on my home router). The text file acts as a reference point that is suppose to contain all vulnerable services and if the tool matches a certain service running on an open port on a given target it alerts about the vulnerability which can then be acted upon. 
The advancedscanner code contains the modified code where i condensed all functions into a single class and then imported the file to the main vulnscanner file.
